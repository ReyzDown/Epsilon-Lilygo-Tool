# Radio Scanner Project

![Project Image](link_to_project_image.png)

This versatile radio scanner is designed to detect and monitor various wireless signals, including Wi-Fi networks, BLE devices, Beacon tags, and LoRa transmissions. With its 0.96" OLED display and LoRa antenna, it provides an intuitive interface for real-time signal information.

## Key Features

- **Wi-Fi Scanning:** Detect and display nearby Wi-Fi networks, including SSIDs, MAC addresses, channels, and signal levels.

- **BLE Scanning:** Identify BLE devices in range, providing device names, MAC addresses, and available services.

- **Beacon Scanning:** Detect Beacon tags, displaying UUIDs, signal strengths, and associated data.

- **LoRa Scanning:** In-progress feature to capture nearby LoRa transmissions.

- **OLED Display:** Clear and intuitive results presentation on a 0.96" OLED screen.

- **LoRa Antenna:** Enhance LoRa signal detection with a dedicated antenna.

## Usage

- Clone the repository.
- Connect your hardware components.
- Upload the code to your microcontroller.
- Monitor wireless signals on the OLED display.
